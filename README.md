This repository contains the source code for a student exercise in the Multiplatform Software Development (Desenvolvimento de Software Multiplataforma - DSM) course.

The main objective of this lesson was to learn the entire process of cloning, customizing, and deploying a static website (developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and successfully hosting it live using GitHub Pages.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This portfolio was created to:

✔ Demonstrate proficiency in Git workflow, including cloning, staging, committing, and pushing code. 
✔ Successfully deploy a static web application using the industry-standard hosting solution, GitHub Pages. 
✔ Practice customization and adaptation of an existing codebase (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to fit personal data and branding. 
✔ Serve as a practical example within the Multiplatform Software Development (DSM) curriculum, showcasing the complete process from code acquisition to live deployment.

## 🚀 Deployment


This project has been successfully deployed and is hosted using GitHub Pages, a free static hosting solution provided by GitHub.

It is important to understand the two main methods for hosting a website on GitHub Pages, as the access URL changes based on the approach used:

1. Project Page (The method used for your class activity)
This method is ideal for class exercises, demonstration repositories, or projects that are not your main personal portfolio.

Create a repository with any name (e.g., Aula-dia-03-12-2025-Hospedando-Site).

Add your files (index.html must be in the root).

Push the code to the main branch.

Activate GitHub Pages in the repository settings, selecting the main branch as the source.

Access: The website will be published at https://username.github.io/repository-name/

2. User Page (Recommended for your Primary Portfolio)
This method is used to create your main personal website, which provides a cleaner, more direct URL.

Create a repository named exactly: username.github.io (where username is your GitHub username).

Add your files (index.html must be in the root).

Push the code to the main branch.

Access: The website will be published directly at https://username.github.io`
